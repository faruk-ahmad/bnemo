   Normally text corpus or text data contains different type of emoji, emoticons to express emotions and sentiment, specially text collected from social media. But this emojis have hardly any meaning in terms of text analysis if those are not converted into corresponding text. From that observation, we are trying to build a database of translation for common emoji, emoticons in Bengali so that Bengali NLP practitionars can use this database to translate emoji, emoticons into Bengali pharases for better understanding of text data. As the initial step, we have created this python package to easily use the emoji, emoticons to Bengali text database in NLP task.

Installation
------------

Install using the following command - 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install bnemo

Uninstall using the following command - 

.. code-block:: bash

   pip uninstall bnemo

Getting Started
---------------

To use ``bnemo`` install it using ``pip``. And make sure you have the required python version in your environment, i.e. ``python >= 3.5``.

Step#1:
~~~~~~~

Import the ``Translator`` class from ``bnemo`` module.

.. code-block:: python

   from bnemo import Translator

Step#2:
~~~~~~~

Create an instance of ``Translator`` class.

.. code-block:: python

   translator = Translator()

Step#3:
~~~~~~~

Use the ``translate()`` method of ``Translator`` class to translate any emoji, emoticons in your Bengali text data.

.. code-block:: python

   input_text = "‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡ßú ‡¶ï‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßá üò≠"
   result = translator.translate(input_text)

Step#4:
~~~~~~~

It will return a ``Result`` object, that has four attributes.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Attribute
     - Data Type
     - Explanation
   * - text
     - String
     - This is the translated text from bnemo
   * - emo
     - List
     - List of all the emoji, emoticons in the given input text
   * - pos
     - List of list
     - This is the list of start and ending index of each emoji in the input text
   * - meaning
     - List of Strings
     - This is the list of meanings for each emoji, emoticons in the input text


Step#5:
~~~~~~~

If you follow the above steps you might get the output as bellow - 

.. code-block:: python

   print(f"Translation: {result.text}\nEmoji: {result.emo}\nPositions: {result.pos}\nMeaning: {result.meaning}")

Output:

.. code-block:: bash

   Translation: ‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡ßú ‡¶ï‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ø
   Emoji: ['üò≠']
   Positions: [[18, 19]]
   Meaning: ['‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶ú‡ßã‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ü‡¶ø']
